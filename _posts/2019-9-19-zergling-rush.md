Zergling rush

Add an evo, then another evo a bit later
+1 melee, +1 carapace, then Lair (all off 1 gas)
Make a shit-tonne of lings off just below 2-base mineral saturation
Nonstop ling attack from multiple angles
Mix drones in at times
@Lair -
+2 melee
2nd gas
Spire
5-7 mutas
Fast 4th base and even 5th if you have minerals
Never take gas until super lategame - just keep massing lings and always be ready to basetrade
